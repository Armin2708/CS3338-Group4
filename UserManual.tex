\section{Introduction}
Welcome to QTC Smart Dashboard! This dashboard design will be the centralized place to display errors, from various databases, providing a more efficient design instead of having multiple places to go for these errors. This smart dashboard will help consolidate errors, especially in the case of a staff member entering bad data. By seeing the errors easily, service desk staff can assist the people entering bad data to prevent it from happening again in the future. Regarding system errors, they are typically more critical as they may affect the whole infrastructure of an application. Being able to see these errors is necessary for the service desk to communicate with the developers. This Smart Dashboard will help ensuring effective communication and error resolution. Key features include real-time error reporting, error severity rating, and customizable dashboards.

\section{Advanced Features}
Using interfaces, our Smart Dashboard will be able to accept error reports from various databases through Case Management Integration (SQL Server). This allows the user or admin to navigate and access data from the database with the following queue from the dashboard. The queue contains some required fields to allow access and searches.  Users can acquire and manage errors via an API.
