## 🖥️ **System Design and Architecture**

### **Workflow**
1. **User Role and Permissions**: Backend validates roles during login.  
2. **Navigation Rendering**: API fetches routes, and frontend renders dynamically.  
3. **Help Interaction**: Backend provides contextual help content displayed in a modal.

### **Security**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Limits visible links and help content based on roles.  
- **Data Encryption**: Secures API communication via HTTPS.  
- **Content Restrictions**: Admin-specific help content is restricted to authorized users.
